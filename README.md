# WebAutomationProject
**Java-Selenium-TestNG-Maven-Jenkins**

Welcome to the Web Automation Project! This project demonstrates the use of **Java**, **Selenium**, **TestNG**, **Maven**, and **Jenkins** for automating web applications. The primary goal of this project is to test the registration form of a web application.

## Project URL
[https://dd-demo-tau.vercel.app/register.html](https://dd-demo-tau.vercel.app/register.html)

## Project Overview
This project automates the registration process of a web application using the Selenium WebDriver. It interacts with form fields such as username, password, email, and submits the form to verify that the registration works as expected.

### Technology Stack
- **Java**: The programming language used to develop the automation scripts.
- **Selenium**: The tool for automating web browsers and interacting with web elements.
- **TestNG**: A testing framework used to organize and execute test cases.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool that manages project dependencies.
- **Jenkins**: A continuous integration tool to automate testing and deployment.

## Reporting
This project generates detailed reports using **TestNG** after each test run. The reports are generated in the `test-output` folder, and they include:
- **Test results**: Passed and failed test cases.
- **Execution time**: The time taken for each test.
- **Error logs**: Detailed error logs for failed tests.

### Sample Report Path
The generated reports can be found in the following directory after the tests are executed:
```
test-output/testng-results.html
```

The report provides a summary of each test case, including its status (pass/fail), execution time, and error details.

## Logging
This project uses **Log4j** for logging purposes. All actions performed during the automation execution are logged to a log file, which helps in debugging and understanding the flow of execution.

### Log File Path
Logs are stored in the `logs` folder with the name `automation.log`.

### Log Levels:
- **INFO**: Provides information about the test execution.
- **ERROR**: Logs error messages when a test fails or encounters issues.
- **DEBUG**: Logs additional details during test execution for debugging purposes.

## How to Set Up and Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. **Java**: Ensure that Java is installed on your machine.
2. **Maven**: Make sure Maven is installed and added to your system's path.
3. **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA**: You can use any IDE that supports Java development.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WebAutomationProject.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd WebAutomationProject
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

4. Run the tests using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

5. After the test execution, check the generated TestNG report in the `test-output` folder.

### Continuous Integration with Jenkins
This project is integrated with **Jenkins** for continuous testing. The Jenkins pipeline is configured to:
- Pull the latest code from the repository.
- Run the tests automatically on each commit.
- Generate test reports.
- Send notifications in case of failures.
